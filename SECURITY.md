# Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please email boswell.labs@gmail.com.

We take security seriously and will respond to security reports within 48 hours. Please include as much detail as possible about the vulnerability, including:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

While the discovery of new vulnerabilities is rare, we also recommend always using the latest version of useRun to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.

## Security Considerations for useRun

As useRun is a CLI tool that runs commands concurrently, please be aware of the following security practices:

- **Command Execution**: useRun executes system commands. Ensure you trust the source of any useRun commands you run.
- **File System Access**: useRun can read from and write to the file system (for example, when commands you run do so). Be cautious when running useRun in directories with sensitive files.

## Security Hall of Fame
